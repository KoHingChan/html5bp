                            Where Wizards Stay Up Late - Origins of the Internet by Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon brings us through the birth and development of the internet.  Hafner and Lyon do not write at a difficult level to read which makes this book a great for many different ages and reading levels.  They first begin by introducting ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency).  ARPA is the section of the United States' Department of Defense in order to carry out many research projects that have or could have defensive uses.

                            Then, they explain that in 1957, Russia had launched a satellite called the Sputnik, which caused a panic in the United States. This was during the Cold War therefore this caused a great pressure on the United States to catch up with Russia in the technology (arms) race.  President Dwight D. Eisenhower had then put a great deal of America's money and effort into such an advancement.  Due to his efforts, the funds for research almost tripled from 5 to 13 billion dollars.  ARPA then became established and known as DARPA which the extra D stands for Defense and many projects became funded, one of them being ARPAnet.

                        <p>
                            ARPAnet was created by J.C.R. Licklider and BBN (Bolt, Beranek, and Newman) Technologies, from this rush of new interest in technology.  The ARPAnet was designed to use packet switching technology instead of batch processing which most computers were using at the time.  Batch processing was slow and did not allow for the computer to gather information from other computers.  The ARPAnet was able to gather information from remotely accessed computers in order to "switch packets" in order to quickly and effectively be used to communicate.  This brought the creation of SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) which allowed for early detection of missiles if any foreign countries were to shoot missiles at them.
