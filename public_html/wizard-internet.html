                    <h1>What is the Internet?</h1>
                    <p>The internet is the relaying of information back and forth through switches and gates as it is feeding through wires.  Currently, we have technology that makes internet seemingly seamless.  However, it takes time to exchange our bits for their bytes.  There are servers out there that have the information that makes up the websites that we visit.  Each of those servers has a name in the form of an Internet Protocol address or IP address. Similarly, our computers on a certain Internet Service Provider provide us with an IP address to connect with the IP address on the server.  When we send a packet to the server we are requesting information from the server.  The server then sends back packets that have small pieces of information that gets reassembled at our end.  The video to your left is a simple visual display of how the internet works.</p>
