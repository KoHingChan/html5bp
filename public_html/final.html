    <p>FINAL</p>
    <p>1. I would use Google AdWords in order to find the best keywords to use in Search Engine Optimization.</p>
    <p>2. The Internet was the product of the Cold War after the scare United States had when the Sputnik was launched into orbit.  John C.R. Licklider, with BBN Technologies, was the one that formulated the mechanism for the internet to be a reality by coming up with a packet based information transmission rather than batch processing.  At that time it was called the ARPAnet which facilitated the use of SAGE which was an antimissile measurement.</p>
    <p>3. ARPAnet is the predecessor of the internet fabricated by BBN and Licklider.  I believe the first time that it was used, it actually crashed when a woman trying to send a message.</p>
    <p>4. President Eisenhower was a great supporter of the sciences.  With his active efforts, he was able to triple the amount of funding for the sciences which subsequently led to the creation of ARPA or DARPA, which then created ARPAnet which then became the internet.</p>
    <p>5. The Internet was created as a military application in order to one effectively communicate data to one another at different locations.  The Internet at the time was a useful application with an anti-missile program known as SAGE created by Licklider.</p>
    <p>6. HTML is more of a document because very little programming goes into HTML.  Most times, HTML is just filled with content just like a document.  The programming usually comes from other languages which are added to the webpage such as python and javascript.</p>
    <p>7. Schema.org is a website which acts as a database for catalogged websites as well as teach others to properly build their website for that purpose.  These catalogged websites were built not as just webpages but database entries.  This allows a website to be used as a data entry and its parts manipulated to be usable in many different formats and applications.  Google uses these database websites in order to show more information about recipes when you search for them in their search engine.</p>
    <p>8. SEO is search engine optimization, two major factors in promoting a site is to capitalize on keywords within the content and meta tags of your website as well as how many people are linking to your site.  Both relevant keywords that are frequently queried as well as more networks to your website greatly increase your Search Engine Optimization.</p>
    <p>9. Adobe Illustrator makes it easier to draw organized items and "create" things because its tools have emphasis on the pen/brush and many other tools that are used for making.  Photoshop is better to "alter and edit" images because most of the tools you see is meant to change what is already there such as blurring, adding a gradient, changing colors, etc.</p>
    <p>10. At least ten html tags html, head, body, a, p, br, link, img, b, em, strong, i, ul, ol, li, table, thead, tr, th, div. </p>
    <p>11. At least 5 CSS Attributes:  margin: controls the spacing outside of the the border of the specified bounds of the division.  padding: controls the spacing between the border and the actual specified bounds of the division.  font-family: controls what typeface you want to use whether it is a serif or san-serif font.  width: controls the horizontal space of a certain division.  height: controls the vertical space of a certain division.  text-align: controls the alignment of the text within the space being modified. color: defaults to modify the color of your text in the space modified.</p>
    <p>12. The difference between class and id is that class is an attribute that can be affixed to multiple items to modify multiple things with CSS.  However, the ID tag can only be affixed to one item and that one item only will be modified under that ID.</p>
    <p>13. The golden rule for the width of 960px is 593px.  Not only do I remember it from having to use it all the time, it is from the ratio of (960+x)/960=1.618.</p>
    <p>14. Float allows for items to attach themselves to a certain side or adjacent item specified by putting either right or left for float. Float generally continues until otherwise specified.  Clear allows you to remove the float either left or right on both sides.</p>
    <p>15. By using  sitemap, one can see the connections that should be there and can doublecheck whether or not the links flow seamlessly.  I would plan out just how many things I need to link from one thing and try to see if I can't keep it down to the rule of 7 +/- 3 in order for a more pleasant website.</p>
    <p>16. The font most commonly used with logos and signs is Helvetica.</p>
    <p>17. A serif font has the serif or edges on the ends of the characters.  Sans-serif as the latin would suggest is without the serif or edges on the end of the character.  A serif font would be Times where a sans-serif font would be Helvetica.</p>
    <p>Essays</p>
    <p>1. In this web development course, I learned a lot about figuring things out for myself.  It allowed me to reinforce the basics and allowed me to have fun with creating websites.  I also learned about the origins of the internet.  To be completely honest, I didn't know much at all about the origins of the internet.  Now it is just stuck in my head because of the final project.  I would like to learn more about programming and web development because I think it's really neat how it is so akin to mathematical problem solving, but a bit more open ended.  I had taken python during my freshman year for Bioinformatics and I would always have to go back to the teacher and convince him that my program works because I would always do it in a different way than he intended for us to do.</p>
    <p>I believe that this course is not much more different than a programming course because of all the multidisciplinary consolidation of skills in order to create a website.  In BNFO we had to take genomic concepts from our Biology knowledge in order to decipher DNA sequences and manipulate the program to find out what we wanted for each said sequence.  In this class, we had to take what we knew about HTML and tie it into CSS and then use Photoshop and Illustrator to create a template to which you work off of in order to build your website.  And if it didn't look as good as you thought it would from the wire frame you could change it and tweak it from there in order to get a better website.</p>
    <p>2. I would change the content of the course a bit.  I know that you mean well when you show us different websites and tell us to look at them as we nitpick each detail.  However, I believe it would be more useful for us if we were to attempt to fix scenarios of a bad website and make them good again.  It would not only give us the conceptual basis as to why there are certain practices in web development as well as the experience of trying to fix it.</p>
    <p>Also, if we were given 1-2 classes a month to just speed-building websites from scratch we would get a bunch of fun competing with each other as well as reinforcing our knowledge of web development.  It's also great to get new perspective from other people that you know.  Maybe you could also get one of your friends to come in and talk to the class about their view on their own web development career.  A fresh perspective does allow more ideas to flow in people's heads.</p>
    <p>3. In the group project I learned that it is all about communication.  Without communication, the project gets pushed back way too many times and work gets shifted in a very weird way.  Then the more capable person will wind up taking more work because that is just how it works out. The reason why it's not fair to displace blame on anyone is because sometimes our schedules conflict way too much.  I just think that there should be some sort of allocation of work at the "beginning" of the project in order to stray away from uncertainty.</p>
    <p>I think the group project though is a great learning tool because in the real world, if you do not network you disappear.  You just become another nobody unless you can work with others.  When you are able to work with others, you spread a piece of your mentality through that person you just worked with on a project.  Your performance is your own business card which people will hand around.  They can say whether or not you were a good or bad partner to work with and that is how your reputation either goes up or goes down.  That's life and we have to deal with it and try to beat it.</p>
