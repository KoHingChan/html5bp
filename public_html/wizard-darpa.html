                    <h1>What is DARPA?</h1>

                    <p>DARPA is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  As the name suggests, it is part of the United States' Department of Defense and is used to conduct research that could potentially have defensive or military applications.  DARPA was first established by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958 in response to the Sputnik being launched into space by the Russians.  America then realized the potential dangers of not being up to date with current technological advances and that it could cost them their status in the world if they were left behind in the technology race.</p>
                    <p>Today, DARPA is open for qualified and bright members of the scientific community to openly experiment with their theories.  They are able to continually feed off their innovation and creativity in a more free environment in order to create revolutionary technology.
