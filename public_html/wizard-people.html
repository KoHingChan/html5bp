                        Dwight David Eisenhower<br/>
                        <p>
                            Dwight David Eisenhower was our 34th President of the United States.  He was a very charismatic character who had an expressed love for the sciences and believed that we should invest our money in developing new technology.  Through his efforts he was able to get DARPA, and other research areas, a substantial sum of money in order to carry out their experiments in order to us to advance in the technological race.  Since his term was during the Cold War, much of political and social pressure was on him in order to make sure that we were always ahead of the Russians.  That was an easier thing to convince the others to support technological advancement after the Russians had launched the Sputnik, a satellite that was the first of its kind, which put Russia's foot in the door for the space race.

                        Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider<br/>
                        <p>
                            Licklider was a bright individual who was well versed in the areas of Math, Physics, and Psychcology.  He gained his interest in informations technology while working as an associate professor at MIT.  He then became the Vice President of BBN inc. due to his breadth of knowledge and past accomplishments.  Licklider was interested in the computer-human interface being relayed in order for quick and easy processing with human input.  This made him noticed by the government as he was asked to be put on a team for ARPA.  This brought him to creating SAGE(Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) as well as the ARPAnet, which eventually led to the internet today.
